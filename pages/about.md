## About Alexander Lippisch Digital Collection

The Alexander Lippisch Papers (1897-1993, undated) contain biographical material, correspondence, scientific research files, materials relating to patents, publications, photographs, and films. In addition to a rich array of material relating to Lippisch's work in aeronautical engineering, the collection also includes biographical material about Lippisch and publications and photographs related to general aviation history.



Scientific research files document Lippisch's work designing sailplanes and gliders, delta-winged aircraft, and aerodynes, as well as research involving aerodynamics, smoke tunnels, and ground effect. These files include materials such as calculations, data, statistics and experimental test results, and technical designs and conceptual drawings of aircraft designs. The collection also includes articles and reports by Lippisch and others.



Highlights of the collection include the technical designs and conceptual drawings of Lippisch's aeronautical designs, and the numerous photographic images and films. The films include brief films of research experiments as well as a number of professionally produced films, such as the series The Secret of Flight.
